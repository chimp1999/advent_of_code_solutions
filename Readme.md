# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the various challenges that are part of the Advent of Code series (https://adventofcode.com/).

Language used is **JAVA**.

The solutions have been categorized into year and day. In order to execute any code -
- Update the main function with the Runner class for the required year.
- Update the execute function inside the appropriate Runner class with the required day & problem part.
- Execute the main function.

The input data is present in resources directory & categorized into Year & Day.

The ouput contains the execution times for each solution. These solutions are part of my journey of improving my Java skills and might not be the most efficient method to solve these problems.

Please feel free to reach out to me with bugs or suggestions for improvements -
